Design Critique:
The architecture of your code shares similarities with conventional design patterns, which is commendable for
maintaining familiarity. However, two design choices stand out. The nested structure of View -> Panel -> HexButton
seems unnecessarily complex, with HexButton incorporating both visual representation and game logic. A cleaner approach
might separate the UI component (HexButton) from the game logic (Cell). This separation would improve modularity and
maintain a clear distinction between the game's presentation and its mechanics.

Another confusing aspect is the use of PlayerColor to represent both player identity and cell state. This overloading
of responsibilities can be misleading. It would be more intuitive to have separate enumerations for player identities
and cell states to enhance readability and maintainability.

Implementation Critique:
The getCellAt() method's current functionality is somewhat misleading. Its name suggests that it would return a cell
object, but it instead returns the cell's state as a PlayerColor. Renaming this method to reflect its actual purpose,
such as getCellStateAt(), would prevent confusion and better convey its functionality.

Documentation Critique:
The documentation is satisfactory, providing a clear understanding of the code's purpose and functionality.
It successfully guides the reader through the codebase, facilitating easier navigation and comprehension.

Design/Code Limitations and Suggestions:
One significant limitation is the handling of key signals within the View. Our approach delegates this responsibility
to the Controller, allowing for customizable user interfaces where different controllers can have independent key
detection logic. This design offers flexibility in adapting the user interface for various user experiences.
To address this limitation, consider refactoring the code to move key event handling to the Controller.
This shift would centralize control logic, allowing for easier updates and modifications to key functionalities across
different interfaces.

Overall, while your code is well-structured and documented, these adjustments could significantly improve its clarity
and flexibility, ensuring a more robust and maintainable codebase.
